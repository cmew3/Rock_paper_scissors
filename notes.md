* tests dont pass :( 
 I think you still have a hang up on the old tests as youre using rock paper scissors.

* You've made a method called loser which isn't tested
* Loser method isn't very dry, it's essentially the same as winner, can you make this better? 

I love the styling, looks awesome. I would have made the pictures clickable though

When I click on my pick it takes me to pick= is undefined error :(

All and all I really like it. You extended some pretty boring code enough to show a good understanding. If you fix these small issues then it'll be pretty good.
