* tests dont pass :( 
 I think you still have a hang up on the old tests as youre using rock paper scissors.
->sorry - have corrected for wand etc!

* You've made a method called loser which isn't tested
-> it seemed to make sense to test in the same scenarios as the winner function but would you generally advise a repeat set of tests?

* Loser method isn't very dry, it's essentially the same as winner, can you make this better?
-> now using winner method? Any better suggestions?

I love the styling, looks awesome. I would have made the pictures clickable though. 
-> I have repeated the form to make words or pictures submit. Is there a better way to do this? In the outcome.erb I have put the images in divs which seems a bit cumbersome? 

When I click on my pick it takes me to pick= is undefined error :(
-> sorry not sure what you mean by this....

All and all I really like it. You extended some pretty boring code enough to show a good understanding. If you fix these small issues then it'll be pretty good.
-> Thanks!
